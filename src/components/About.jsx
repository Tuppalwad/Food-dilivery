          Although millets have been consumed by humans for about 7,000 years,
          little has been known about them. In todayâ€™s world, where there are
          abundant amounts of fast-food chains serving foods on-the-go, and with
          the humans being very busy working and living stressful lives, the old
          tradition of eating millets has vanished. Although it is very true
          that the same people have started becoming more health-conscious,
          thanks to their prudence.

              <p className="text-wrap">
                Millets are a group of small-seeded grasses, widely grown around
                the world as cereal crops or grains for fodder and human food.
                Millets are important crops in the semiarid tropics of Asia and
                Africa where they are grown on marginal lands.

                Popularly termed as Super grains, millets are not only rich in
                nutrition, but also carry a rich history dating back to the
                Indian Bronze Age (4500 BC). Sadly, as years passed, their
                importance reduced to being meagre birdseed. Only to realise
                that itâ€™s the need of the hour.

                Considering the lifestyle that we lead, especially our eating
                habits, where todayâ€™s generation is obsessed with street foods &
                other mouth-watering food items that are heavily induced with
                trans fat, bad carbohydrates, fats & high-cholesterol, eating
                healthy has now become a matter of need more than choice.

                What better way to start this healthy eating journey than by
                reconnecting with our roots through millets? An array of grains
                varying in shapes, sizes and colour, millets are gluten-free and
                non- allergenic. Additionally, they are rich in minerals,
                vitamins & fibre.

                Millets are an excellent choice to replace your regular food as
                they are not only delicious & high in nutrition, they have less
                calorie count, improve immunity, curb hunger, reduce
                sugar-levels & aid in curing heart problems. Plus, they are
                available in the markets at all times, and throughout the year,
                as they are climate-friendly.

                Knowing the ample benefits that these millets provide you with,
